#HillCypher-Encryption

> Encrypts plaintext using the Hill cipher in C. Reads an n×n key matrix from file, filters alphabetic characters, converts to lowercase, pads with 'x', then performs matrix-vector modulo-26 encryption and outputs ciphertext formatted in 80-character lines.

**Hill Cipher Encryption — C (CIS3360)**  
• Implemented full Hill Cipher encryption using matrix multiplication + modulo-26 arithmetic  
• Read key + plaintext files via CLI, filtered and normalized text, padded input for alignment  
• Dynamically allocated key matrix 2×2–9×9 and produced formatted ciphertext output

If you'd like, I can also generate:

🔹 badges (C, cryptography, algorithms, security)  
🔹 a banner README header  
🔹 a GIF-style example run for GitHub  
🔹 short tagline version (for pinned repo display)

Just say *"add badges"* or *"make it look cooler"* 😎
